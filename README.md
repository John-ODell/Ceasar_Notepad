Encrypted Notepad by John O'Dell

In this version you are able to put in the actual number of the Ceaser Cypher you want to encrypt. The input field will accept digits 1-99 with numbers greater than 26 following the equation (n/4)+1.

This is the last iteration of the encrypted notepad using a Ceaser Cypher. The best way to remember what you have incoded is to put the number chosen to encrypt x the number of times the encrpyt button was pressed

    [message] 15x4 = [message] cypher 15 press decrpyt 4 times
